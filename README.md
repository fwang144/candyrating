To start looking into my project or test, follow a Python Django Environment.
  1. Open Terminal
  2. Type "python --version" to check the version and see if you installed Python.
  3. To check if you have Django, type "PIP --version".
  4. If you don't have pip installed, here is the link: https://pypi.org/project/pip/
  5. To create a virtual environment, for Windows: type "py -m venv myworld", for Mac/Unix: type "python -m venv myworld".
  6. To activate a virtual environment, for Windows: type "myworld\Scripts\activate.bat", for Mac/Unix: type "source myworld/bin/activate"
  7. Navigate to the files that was downloaded or clone and type "code ." to open in Microsoft Visual Code.
  8. To run the project type and view it under LocalHost, type "py manage.py runserver".
  9. To run the unit testing, type in "py manage.py test".
